==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::EntryTitles - Posy plugin to cache entry titles


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.40'' of Posy::Plugin::EntryTitles.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This is a "utility" plugin to be used by other plugins; it maintains a list
(and cache) of entry titles in $self->{titles} which can be used by other
plugins (such as Posy::Plugin::NearLinks).

It provides an action method "index_titles" which should be put after
"index_entries" in the action list.

This plugin is useful not only for efficiency reasons, but it means that
other plugins don't have to know how to extract the title from a given
format of file; the title for a HTML file, for example, is not parsed in the
same way as that for a plain text file. Those who wish to introduce
additional formats need only override the "get_title" method and everything
will work just as smoothly. Ah, inheritance, I love it.


==== REQUIRES ====

    Posy
    Posy::Core
